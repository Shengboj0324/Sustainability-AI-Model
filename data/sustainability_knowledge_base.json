RECYCLABLE in most programs.\n\n#2 HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene): Milk jugs, detergent bottles, shampoo bottles. HIGHLY RECYCLABLE.\n\n#3 PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride): Pipes, vinyl siding, some packaging. RARELY RECYCLABLE - check locally.\n\n#4 LDPE (Low-Density Polyethylene): Plastic bags, squeeze bottles, bread bags. SOMETIMES RECYCLABLE - often requires special drop-off.\n\n#5 PP (Polypropylene): Yogurt containers, bottle caps, straws. INCREASINGLY RECYCLABLE.\n\n#6 PS (Polystyrene): Foam cups, takeout containers, packing peanuts. RARELY RECYCLABLE - avoid when possible.\n\n#7 Other: Mixed plastics, bioplastics. USUALLY NOT RECYCLABLE - varies by facility.\n\nBest practices: Rinse containers, remove labels when possible, check local guidelines, never bag recyclables in plastic bags.",

      "content": "8 million metric tons of plastic enter oceans annually. By 2050, oceans may contain more plastic than fish by weight. 5 trillion plastic pieces currently float in oceans. Great Pacific Garbage Patch is twice the size of Texas. Microplastics found in 90% of seabirds, 100% of sea turtles. Plastic kills 1 million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals yearly. Solutions: Reduce single-use plastics, support ocean cleanup initiatives, proper waste disposal, beach cleanups.",
